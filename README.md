# Community Water Watch

A community-led water quality monitoring project focused on residential water wells near hydraulic fracturing (fracking) sites in the Marcellus Shale region (Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia). The project collects and analyzes water samples from volunteers' private wells within a one-mile radius of active drilling operations.

## Goals

- Provide transparent, publicly accessible data on water quality near fracking sites.
- Empower communities with tools to monitor potential contamination.
- Compare contaminant levels against EPA drinking water screening levels.

## Data Sources

- Water sample results from certified laboratories (ALS Environmental, Pace Analytical).
- Volunteer-submitted sample data via our web portal.
- Publicly available drilling permit data from state regulatory agencies.

## Repository Structure

- `/data/raw` – Raw laboratory reports (CSV format).
- `/data/processed` – Cleaned and standardized data.
- `/analysis` – Python scripts for statistical analysis and visualization.
- `/reports` – Generated summaries and public-facing reports.
